This document describes how to build EasyTransfer from source.

Linux and similar systems
=========================

1. Install the following packages, the packages names may be different on your
   system:

   `sudo apt install libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev libftdi-dev and libusb-dev`

2. Compile it (as normal user):

   `make`

   If you need the command line tool `ef3xfer` only, you can use:

   `make ef3xfer`

3. Install it (optional, as root) using this command:

   `sudo make install`

Step 3 should create a menu entry for Gnome, KDE or Xfce. Note that make
install does not work for `ef3xfer` only.

Permissions on Linux
--------------------

To access the EasyFlash 3 on Debian derived systems without being root, create
a new udev rule file:

sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/80-easyflash.rules

add following content:

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="8738", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"

finally re-plug your EasyFlash 3.

Add your user account to the group plugdev, log out and log in again.
Other distributions might work similar.

Windows
=======

To cross compile the software on Linux for Windows, you need the following
packages (Debian/Ubuntu naming):

`sudo apt install gcc-mingw-w64-i686 g++-mingw-w64-i686 cmake dos2unix`

Then build it:

`make win32=yes`

Mac OS X
========

Should work similar as a Linux build.

Other platforms
===============

It may be possible to compile EasyTransfer on other platforms. The most
important precondition is that wxWidgets and libftdi run on that box.

If you get it running somewhere else, I appreciate a report :)
